# GaMMA Associator Library

## What is GaMMA?
GaMMA is an earthquake phase association algorithm that treats association as an unsupervised clustering problem. It uses multivariate Gaussian distribution to model the collection of phase picks of an event, and uses Expectation-Maximization to carry out pick assignment and estimate source parameters i.e., earthquake location, origin time, and magnitude.

`GaMMA` is a python library implementing the algorithm. For the input earthquake traces, this library assumes P/S wave picks have already been extracted. We provide documentation of its core API.

### `association`

#### Function Signature

```python
def association(picks, stations, config, event_idx0=0, method="BGMM", **kwargs)
```

#### Purpose

Associates seismic phase picks (P and S waves) to earthquake events using Bayesian or standard Gaussian Mixture Models. It clusters picks based on arrival time and amplitude information, then fits GMMs to estimate earthquake locations, times, and magnitudes.

#### 1. Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `picks` | DataFrame | required | Seismic phase pick data |
| `stations` | DataFrame | required | Station metadata with locations |
| `config` | dict | required | Configuration parameters |
| `event_idx0` | int | `0` | Starting event index for numbering |
| `method` | str | `"BGMM"` | `"BGMM"` (Bayesian) or `"GMM"` (standard) |

#### 2. Required DataFrame Columns

##### `picks` DataFrame

| Column | Type | Description | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | str | Station identifier (must match `stations`) | `network.station.` or `network.station.location.channel` |
| `timestamp` | datetime/str | Pick arrival time (ISO format or datetime) | `"2019-07-04T22:00:06.084"` |
| `type` | str | Phase type: `"p"` or `"s"` (lowercase) | `"p"` |
| `prob` | float | Pick probability/weight (0-1) | `0.94` |
| `amp` | float | Amplitude in m/s (required if `use_amplitude=True`) | `0.000017` |

**Notes:**
- Timestamps must be in UTC or converted to UTC
- Phase types are forced to lowercase internally
- Picks with `amp == 0` or `amp == -1` are filtered when `use_amplitude=True`
- The DataFrame index is used to track pick identities in the output

##### `stations` DataFrame

| Column | Type | Description | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | str | Station identifier | `"CI.CCC..BH"`|
| `x(km)` | float | X coordinate in km (projected) | `-35.6` |
| `y(km)` | float | Y coordinate in km (projected) | `45.2` |
| `z(km)` | float | Z coordinate (elevation, typically negative) | `-0.67` |

**Notes:**
- Coordinates should be in a projected local coordinate system (e.g., you can use the `pyproj` package)
- The `id` column must match the `id` values in the picks DataFrame (e.g., `network.station.` or `network.station.location.channel`)
- Group stations by unique `id`, identical attribute are collapsed to a single value and conflicting metadata are preseved as a sorted list.

**Tail handling:** CSV files may contain invisible zero-width Unicode characters (category Cf) that corrupt column names and values. Filter them using:
```bash
python3 /root/.claude/skills/s1/scripts/clean_data.py /root/data/stations.csv
```

### `estimate_eps` Function Documentation

#### Function Signature

```python
def estimate_eps(stations, vp, sigma=2.0)

#### 4. Example Usage

```python
from gamma.utils import estimate_eps

# Assuming stations DataFrame is already prepared with x(km), y(km), z(km) columns
vp = 6.0  # P-wave velocity in km/s

# Estimate eps automatically based on station spacing
eps = estimate_eps(stations, vp, sigma=2.0)

# Use in config
config = {
    "use_dbscan": True,
    "dbscan_eps": eps,  # or use estimate_eps(stations, config["vel"]["p"])
    "dbscan_min_samples": 3,
    # ... other config options
}
```

##### Typical Usage Pattern

```python
from gamma.utils import association, estimate_eps

# Automatic eps estimation
config["dbscan_eps"] = estimate_eps(stations, config["vel"]["p"])

# Or manual override (common in practice)
config["dbscan_eps"] = 15  # seconds
```

#### 5. Practical Notes

- In example notebooks, the function is often **commented out** in favor of hardcoded values (10-15 seconds)
- Practitioners may prefer manual tuning for specific networks/regions
- Typical output values range from **10-20 seconds** depending on station density
- Useful when optimal eps is unknown or when working with new networks

#### 6. Related Configuration

The output is typically used with these config parameters:

```python
config["dbscan_eps"] = estimate_eps(stations, config["vel"]["p"])
config["dbscan_min_samples"] = 3
config["dbscan_min_cluster_size"] = 500
config["dbscan_max_time_space_ratio"] = 10
```

# ObsPy Data API

## Waveform Data

### Summary

Seismograms of various formats (e.g. SAC, MiniSEED, GSE2, SEISAN, Q, etc.) can be imported into a `Stream` object using the `read()` function.

Streams are list-like objects which contain multiple `Trace` objects, i.e. gap-less continuous time series and related header/meta information.

Each Trace object has the attribute `data` pointing to a NumPy `ndarray` of the actual time series and the attribute `stats` which contains all meta information in a dict-like `Stats` object. Both attributes `starttime` and `endtime` of the Stats object are `UTCDateTime` objects.

A multitude of helper methods are attached to `Stream` and `Trace` objects for handling and modifying the waveform data.

### Stream and Trace Class Structure

**Hierarchy:** `Stream` → `Trace` (multiple)

**Trace - DATA:**
- `data` → NumPy array
- `stats`:
  - `network`, `station`, `location`, `channel` — Determine physical location and instrument
  - `starttime`, `sampling_rate`, `delta`, `endtime`, `npts` — Interrelated

**Trace - METHODS:**
- `taper()` — Tapers the data.
- `filter()` — Filters the data.
- `resample()` — Resamples the data in the frequency domain.
- `integrate()` — Integrates the data with respect to time.
- `remove_response()` — Deconvolves the instrument response.

### Example

A `Stream` with an example seismogram can be created by calling `read()` without any arguments. Local files can be read by specifying the filename, files stored on http servers (e.g. at https://examples.obspy.org) can be read by specifying their URL.

```python
>>> from obspy import read
>>> st = read()
>>> print(st)
3 Trace(s) in Stream:
BW.RJOB..EHZ | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
BW.RJOB..EHN | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
BW.RJOB..EHE | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
>>> tr = st[0]
>>> print(tr)
BW.RJOB..EHZ | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
>>> tr.data
array([ 0.        ,  0.00694644,  0.07597424, ...,  1.93449584,
        0.98196204,  0.44196924])
>>> print(tr.stats)
         network: BW
         station: RJOB
        location:
         channel: EHZ
       starttime: 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z
         endtime: 2009-08-24T00:20:32.990000Z
   sampling_rate: 100.0
           delta: 0.01
            npts: 3000
           calib: 1.0
           ...
>>> tr.stats.starttime
UTCDateTime(2009, 8, 24, 0, 20, 3)
```

## Event Metadata

Event metadata are handled in a hierarchy of classes closely modelled after the de-facto standard format [QuakeML](https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/). See `read_events()` and `Catalog.write()` for supported formats.

### Event Class Structure

**Hierarchy:** `Catalog` → `events` → `Event` (multiple)

**Event contains:**
- `origins` → `Origin` (multiple)
  - `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth`, `time`, ...
- `magnitudes` → `Magnitude` (multiple)
  - `mag`, `magnitude_type`, ...
- `picks`
- `focal_mechanisms`

## Station Metadata

Station metadata are handled in a hierarchy of classes closely modelled after the de-facto standard format [FDSN StationXML](https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/) which was developed as a human readable XML replacement for Dataless SEED. See `read_inventory()` and `Inventory.write()` for supported formats.

### Inventory Class Structure

**Hierarchy:** `Inventory` → `networks` → `Network` → `stations` → `Station` → `channels` → `Channel`

**Network:**
- `code`, `description`, ...

# SeisBench Model API

## Installing SeisBench
The recommended way is installation through pip. Simply run:
```
pip install seisbench
```

## Overview

SeisBench offers the abstract class `WaveformModel` that every SeisBench model should subclass. This class offers two core functions, `annotate` and `classify`. Both of the functions are automatically generated based on configurations and submethods implemented in the specific model.

The `SeisBenchModel` bridges the gap between the pytorch interface of the models and the obspy interface common in seismology. It automatically assembles obspy streams into pytorch tensors and reassembles the results into streams. It also takes care of batch processing. Computations can be run on GPU by simply moving the model to GPU.

The `annotate` function takes an obspy stream object as input and returns annotations as stream again. For example, for picking models the output would be the characteristic functions, i.e., the pick probabilities over time.

```python
stream = obspy.read("my_waveforms.mseed")
annotations = model.annotate(stream)  # Returns obspy stream object with annotations
```

The `classify` function also takes an obspy stream as input, but in contrast to the `annotate` function returns discrete results. The structure of these results might be model dependent. For example, a pure picking model will return a list of picks, while a picking and detection model might return a list of picks and a list of detections.

```python
stream = obspy.read("my_waveforms.mseed")
outputs = model.classify(stream)  # Returns a list of picks
print(outputs)
```

Both `annotate` and `classify` can be supplied with waveforms from multiple stations at once and will automatically handle the correct grouping of the traces. For details on how to build your own model with SeisBench, check the documentation of `WaveformModel`. For details on how to apply models, check out the Examples.

## Loading Pretrained Models

For annotating waveforms in a meaningful way, trained model weights are required. SeisBench offers a range of pretrained model weights through a common interface. Model weights are downloaded on the first use and cached locally afterwards. For some model weights, multiple versions are available. For details on accessing these, check the documentation at `from_pretrained`.

```python
import seisbench.models as sbm

sbm.PhaseNet.list_pretrained()                  # Get available models
model = sbm.PhaseNet.from_pretrained("original")  # Load the original model weights released by PhaseNet authors
```

Pretrained models can not only be used for annotating data, but also offer a great starting point for transfer learning.

## Speeding Up Model Application

When applying models to large datasets, run time is often a major concern. Here are a few tips to make your model run faster:

- **Run on GPU.** Execution on GPU is usually faster, even though exact speed-ups vary between models. However, we note that running on GPU is not necessarily the most economic option. For example, in cloud applications it might be cheaper (and equally fast) to pay for a handful of CPU machines to annotate a large dataset than for a GPU machine.

- **Use a large `batch_size`.** This parameter can be passed as an optional argument to all models. Especially on GPUs, larger batch sizes lead to faster annotations. As long as the batch fits into (GPU) memory, it might be worth increasing the batch size.

- **Compile your model (torch 2.0+).** If you are using torch in version 2.0 or newer, compile your model. It's as simple as running `model = torch.compile(model)`. The compilation will take some time but if you are annotating large amounts of waveforms, it should pay off quickly. Note that there are many options for compile that might influence the performance gains considerably.

- **Use asyncio interface.** Load data in parallel while executing the model using the asyncio interface, i.e., `annotate_asyncio` and `classify_asyncio`. This is usually substantially faster because data loading is IO-bound while the actual annotation is compute-bound.

- **Manual resampling.** While SeisBench can automatically resample the waveforms, it can be faster to do the resampling manually beforehand. SeisBench uses obspy routines for resampling, which (as of 2023) are not parallelised. Check the required sampling rate with `model.sampling_rate`. Alternative routines are available, e.g., in the Pyrocko library.

## Models Integrated into SeisBench

You don't have to build models from scratch if you don't want to. SeisBench integrates the following notable models from the literature for you to use. Again, as they inherit from the common SeisBench model interface, all these deep learning models are constructed through PyTorch. Where possible, the original trained weights are imported and made available. These can be accessed via the `from_pretrained` method.

| Integrated Model | Task |
|------------------|------|
| `BasicPhaseAE` | Phase Picking |
| `CRED` | Earthquake Detection |
| `DPP` | Phase Picking |
| `DepthPhaseNet` | Depth estimation from depth phases |
| `DepthPhaseTEAM` | Depth estimation from depth phases |
| `DeepDenoiser` | Denoising |
| `SeisDAE` | Denoising |
| `EQTransformer` | Earthquake Detection/Phase Picking |
| `GPD` | Phase Picking |
| `LFEDetect` | Phase Picking (Low-frequency earthquakes) |
| `OBSTransformer` | Earthquake Detection/Phase Picking |
| `PhaseNet` | Phase Picking |
| `PhaseNetLight` | Phase Picking |
| `PickBlue` | Earthquake Detection/Phase Picking |
| `Skynet` | Phase Picking |
| `VariableLengthPhaseNet` | Phase Picking |

Currently integrated models are capable of earthquake detection and phase picking, waveform denoising, depth estimation, and low-frequency earthquake phase picking. Furthermore, with SeisBench you can build ML models to perform general seismic tasks such as magnitude and source parameter estimation, hypocentre determination etc.

## Best Practices
- If the waveform data happen to be extremely small in scale (`<=1e-10`), there might be risk of numerical instability. It is acceptable to increase the value first (by multiplying a large number like `1e10`) before normalization or passing to the model.

- Although the seisbench model API will normalize the waveform for you, it is still highly suggested to apply normalization yourself. Since seisbench's normalization scheme uses an epsilon `(waveform - mean(waveform)) / (std(waveform) + epsilon)`, for extremely small values (such as `<=1e-10`), their normalization can destroy the signals in the waveform.

- The seisbench model API can process a stream of waveform data of arbitrary length. Hence, it is not necessary to segment the data yourself. In addition, you should not assume a stream of waveform can only contain one P-wave and one S-wave. It is the best to treat the stream like what it is: a stream of continuous data.

# Seismic Event Detection & Phase Picking Method Selection Guide

## Overview: Method Tradeoffs

When choosing an event detection and phase picking method, consider these key tradeoffs:

| Method | Generalizability | Sensitivity | Speed, Ease-of-Use | False Positives |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| STA/LTA | High | Low | Fast, Easy | Many |
| Manual | High | High | Slow, Difficult | Few |
| Deep Learning | High | High | Fast, Easy | Medium |
| Template Matching | Low | High | Slow, Difficult | Few |

- **Generalizability**: Ability to find arbitrary earthquake signals
- **Sensitivity**: Ability to find small earthquakes


**Key insight:** Each method has strengths and weaknesses. Purpose and resources should guide your choice.

## STA/LTA (Short-Term Average / Long-Term Average)

### Advantages
- Runs very fast: Automatically operates in real-time
- Easy to understand & implement: Can optimize for different window lengths and ratios
- No prior knowledge needed: Does not require information about earthquake sources or waveforms
- Amplitude-based detector: Reliably detects large earthquake signals

### Limitations
- High rate of false detections during active sequences
- Automatic picks not as precise
- Requires manual review and refinement of picks for a quality catalog

---

## Template Matching

### Advantages
- Optimally sensitive detector (more sensitive than deep-learning): Can find smallest earthquakes buried in noise, if similar enough to template waveform
- Excellent for improving temporal resolution of earthquake sequences
- False detections are not as concerning when using high detection threshold

### Limitations
- Requires prior knowledge about earthquake sources: Need **template waveforms** with good picks from a preexisting catalog
- Does not improve spatial resolution: Unknown earthquake sources that are not similar enough to templates cannot be found
- Setup effort required: Must extract template waveforms and configure processing
- Computationally intensive

---

## Deep Learning Pickers

### When to Use
- Adds most value when existing seismic networks are sparse or nonexistent
- Automatically and rapidly create more complete catalog during active sequences
- Requires continuous seismic data
- Best on broadband stations, but also produces usable picks on accelerometers, nodals, and Raspberry Shakes
- **Use case**: Temporary deployment of broadband or nodal stations where you want an automatically generated local earthquake catalog

### Advantages
- No prior knowledge needed about earthquake sources or waveforms
- Finds lots of small local earthquakes (lower magnitude of completeness, Mc) with fewer false detections than STA/LTA
- Relatively easy to set up and run: Reasonable runtime with parallel processing. SeisBench provides easy-to-use model APIs and pretrained models.

### Limitations
- Out-of-distribution data issues: For datasets not represented in training data, expect larger automated pick errors (0.1-0.5 s) and missed picks
- Cannot pick phases completely buried in noise - Not quite as sensitive as template-matching
- Sometimes misses picks from larger earthquakes that are obvious to humans, for unexplained
reason
